Artist's Statement
------------------

How to describe Uno? He's red. He's fuzzy. He's round, about an inch across and moves several inches a second. We see that he stays about the same size, even when he is partially hidden from view.

Uno is whole. There is one of him. Counting we find one. He is the integer one. A whole number. Uno.

Uno asks us to question whole numbers. Although he appears whole, he is whole only in our perception. He is actually a distribution of blinking lights, not a whole anything.

Neither are we a whole anything. We believe in whole numbers, integers, because we perceive ourselves as whole. If there are three of us in a room then our count equals 3, not 3.0001 or 2.9999. But what are we counting? Only in our perception is any of us whole; any of us an integer.
